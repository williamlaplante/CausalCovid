# Application of Probabilistic Numerics to Epidemiology

In this repository, we apply methods developed in the paper available at: https://openreview.net/forum?id=7e4FLufwij

We (1) extend the approach to make it more statistically valid, (2) estimate the instantaneous reproductive number in Canada for the COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) illustrate the impact of Probabilistic Numerics when applied to Epidemiology.

We also wish to utilize the model to make causal claims about governmental measures. But at the moment, this approach hasn't been implemented.
