# Application of Probabilistic Numerics to Epidemiology

In this repository, we apply methods developed in the paper available at: https://openreview.net/forum?id=7e4FLufwij

We (1) extend the approach to make it more statistically valid, (2) estimate the instantaneous reproductive number in Canada for the COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) illustrate the impact of Probabilistic Numerics when applied to Epidemiology.
